  <h2>What I Learned from Digital Literacy</h2>
  <div class="learning">
    <p>I learned the critical importance of managing my digital footprint responsibly to protect my privacy, security, and online reputation. Specific strategies I gained knowledge of include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Regularly checking the privacy and security settings on all my social media profiles and apps</li>
      <li>Being diligent about clearing my cookies, browsing history, and cached files across all my devices</li>
      <li>Cautiously avoiding oversharing personal contact details, addresses, schedules, or other sensitive information publicly online</li>
      <li>Using strong unique passwords for each account with a password manager along with multi-factor authentication when available</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also learned several effective search techniques that will allow me to improve my online research and ability to locate accurate, credible information efficiently:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Identifying key concepts or topics and determining important keywords and search terms</li>
      <li>Leveraging advanced Google operators to narrow down search results</li>
      <li>Evaluating factors like source expertise, recency, evidence provided, and agreement from multiple reputable sites to ascertain credibility</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For improving my email communication, I learned several best practices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Crafting concise, descriptive subject lines and starting with a proper greeting</li>
      <li>Being concise yet thorough while tailoring the information to what the recipient needs to know</li>
      <li>Signing off with an appropriate closing and my name</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I gained an introduction to the field of artificial intelligence and some awareness of key machine learning concepts. I learned about the distinction between weak/narrow AI and strong AI, supervised and unsupervised learning, and the risks and ethical considerations surrounding AI systems.</p>
    <p>What I have already used:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Started using more secure password habits and enabling multi-factor authentication</li>
      <li>Become more diligent about regularly checking and clearing cookies, browsing history, and cache</li>
      <li>Avoided publicly sharing personal contact details on social media or other public-facing sites</li>
      <li>Applied email best practices for clearer communication</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What I plan to use in the future:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Continue monitoring and refining privacy settings on social media profiles and apps</li>
      <li>Systematically apply search strategy knowledge for better online research</li>
      <li>Spread digital literacy awareness and provide feedback on AI development</li>
      <li>Guide others' digital literacy where appropriate in my community</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In summary, I learned many practical skills and mindsets around online safety, effective searching, clear communication, and responsible use of emerging technology. With ongoing refinement and sharing of knowledge, I can help shape an ethical digital future.</p>
